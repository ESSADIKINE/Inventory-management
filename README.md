# Inventory-management

### javafx-mysql-inventory-management (gestion de stock)

## About the Project:
This is an inventory management system that uses a JavaFX frontend, a Java API, and MySQL for a database. It allows a store's inventory staff to log in securely with a custom role based access control system. Product inventory, customer invoices, and product category are the main features of this project that are currently completed.

## Motivation:

In early 2023, I wanted to make a simple application for my portfolio that could exemplify my knowledge of Java and SQL to potential employers. I started this personal project to enhance my understanding of UI development, middleware development, and database development.

### 👤 Add New Contacts: 
Users can easily add new contacts to their address book by providing the contact's name, phone number, and email address.

### 👁 View All Contacts: 
The app displays a list of all the saved contacts, allowing users to quickly access their contact information.

### 🖍 Update Contact Information: 
Users have the ability to edit and update contact details, ensuring the information is always up-to-date.

### 🗑 Delete Contacts: 
If a user no longer needs a contact, they can delete it from their address book using the app.
   ### Confirmation Dialog: 
When the user clicks on the "Delete" button, display a confirmation dialog to ensure that the user wants to proceed with the action. The dialog should have "Delete" and "Cancel" buttons.

### 📞 Call Contact: 
Users can initiate a phone call directly from the app by tapping on a contact's phone number.

### 🔎 Search Contacts: 
The app includes a search functionality that allows users to quickly find specific contacts by typing in their name or phone number.

## Technologies Used:

<h6>Java:</h6> The programming language used to develop the Android application.

<h6>SQLite Database:</h6> A lightweight, embedded database used to store and manage contact information locally on the device.

<h6>Android Studio:</h6> The integrated development environment (IDE) used for Android app development.
